    Ever wondered how to tell if an application is ready for production? Well, letâ€™s see what these principles are 
    and how they can make your life easy.

    Production readiness refers to when a certain application or a program will be ready to operate. Once the 
    application is made, we call it a production-ready application. At this point, the application should be capable 
    of handling production-level traffic, data and security.

    Once an application is marked production-ready, it can be trusted completely to handle its real work. Following 
    the principles of availability, the application should be available for all the intended users.
